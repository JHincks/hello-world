YAHWR - yet another hello-world-repo

i am trying to teach my-self coding. As of May 11th, 2017 i am still at the very beginning of that process.
i am interested in
  - linux generally
    ~ specifically archlinux-nosystemd, puppylinux, gentoo/funtoo - but last two are still quite beyond my comprehension ;)
  - python, qt, i3wm, RenPy
  - functionality before cosmetics - quality before quantity
  - KISS - my favorite song is 'i was made for loving you' ...just kidding ;)

In my daily profession i have absolutely nothing to do with computers (at rare occasions i use the calculater in my phone) - so it's all hobby.

let's see what will come.
